# What is this?

This is a simple thing that proxies the discord client replacing some
endpoints with these defined in the `instances.json` file

# How to use it?

Add your instance to `instances.json` file
([See example here](./instances.example.json)) then launch the proxy using
`npm start` (or `bun index.ts`) and go to `http://localhost:3000` to select an instance
